# Kubernetes GitOps with ArgoCD

A presentation for DEV.BG held on 11.12.2025.

Ideally, all the demo steps/parts should be executed. This way, the user will have a basic (a thin one) understanding of how **ArgoCD** could be used to implement the **GitOps** practices in a **Kubernetes** environment.

Realistically, pick just the parts that make sense in the current situation. :)

## Supporting files

Files are provided in the following structure:

* ***demo*** folder contains the actual demo steps

* ***preparation*** folder contains a set of steps and files that could be used to setup the environment

* ***slides.pdf*** file contains the slides of the presentation

## Requirements

A station with installed ***kubectl*** and ***helm*** binaries, and access to ***one*** Kubernetes cluster.

From a workload/component point of view, the demo environment configuration looks like this:

The actual demonstration uses a single all-in-one Kubernetes cluster created with ***minikube***. Of course, another setup, either on-premises or in the cloud, could be used. Depending on the difference, the demo script/steps may need some adjustments.
